# PRP-23: Telemetry and Distributed Tracing

## Overview
Implement comprehensive telemetry with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, metrics export, and centralized logging.

## Context
- Need observability across all components
- Must trace requests through pipelines
- Should export to standard backends
- Need correlation between logs/metrics/traces

## Requirements
1. Setup OpenTelemetry SDK
2. Implement distributed tracing
3. Add trace context propagation
4. Configure exporters
5. Correlate logs with traces

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create src/telemetry/mod.rs module
2. Setup OpenTelemetry:
   - Tracer provider
   - Meter provider
   - Context propagation
   - Resource attributes
3. Implement tracing spans:
   - Stream operation spans
   - Pipeline processing spans
   - API request spans
   - Recording operation spans
4. Add context propagation:
   - Extract from HTTP headers
   - Inject into responses
   - Pass through pipelines
   - Maintain parent relationships
5. Configure exporters:
   - OTLP exporter setup
   - Jaeger exporter option
   - Prometheus metrics bridge
   - Console exporter for debug
6. Integrate with logging:
   - Add trace IDs to logs
   - Use tracing subscriber
   - Structured log fields
   - Log sampling based on trace
7. Add performance tracking:
   - Frame processing latency
   - Pipeline startup time
   - API response times
   - Resource utilization

## Validation Gates
```bash
# Test telemetry setup
cargo test --package stream-manager telemetry::tests

# Verify trace generation
cargo test distributed_tracing

# Check exporter configuration
cargo test telemetry_export
```

## Dependencies
- PRP-13: Metrics collection
- PRP-11: API for trace propagation

## References
- OpenTelemetry Rust: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust
- Tracing subscriber: https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing
- OTLP protocol: OpenTelemetry specification

## Success Metrics
- Traces generated for operations
- Metrics exported successfully
- Logs correlated with traces
- Performance overhead minimal
