# PRP: Native TLS and Security Support

## Overview
Implement proper TLS support using the GIO TLS integration in RTSPConnection, replacing the current incomplete TLS handling and enabling secure RTSP connections.

## Background
Current implementation has TODO comments for TLS support and cannot properly store TlsDatabase/TlsInteraction due to Send+Sync requirements. The RTSPConnection provides complete TLS support through GIO with certificate validation, custom databases, and user interaction.

## Requirements
- Enable rtsps:// URL support with TLS
- Support custom certificate validation
- Allow custom TLS certificate databases
- Implement TLS interaction for certificate acceptance
- Support TLS validation flag configuration

## Technical Context
RTSPConnection TLS features:
- `set_tls_database()` - Custom certificate store
- `set_tls_validation_flags()` - Control validation
- `set_tls_interaction()` - User prompts for certificates
- `get_tls()` - Access underlying TlsConnection
- Automatic TLS negotiation for rtsps:// URLs

Current limitations:
- No rtsps:// support in connection code
- Cannot store TlsDatabase/TlsInteraction (TODO at line 808)
- No certificate validation options

## Implementation Tasks
1. Enable rtsps:// URL recognition and handling
2. Implement tls-database property with RTSPConnection
3. Add tls-validation-flags property mapping
4. Create tls-interaction property support
5. Add certificate validation signal emission
6. Implement custom certificate acceptance callback
7. Update connection creation for TLS URLs
8. Add TLS-specific error handling

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests with mock TLS server
- Certificate validation tests
- Self-signed certificate handling
- TLS version negotiation tests

## Validation Gates
```bash
# Build with TLS features
cargo build --package gst-plugin-rtsp --all-features

# TLS-specific tests
cargo test --package gst-plugin-rtsp tls

# Integration test with TLS server
cargo test --package gst-plugin-rtsp --features integration tls_server
```

## Success Metrics
- Successfully connects to rtsps:// URLs
- Certificate validation works as configured
- Custom certificate databases function correctly
- No security vulnerabilities in TLS handling

## Dependencies
- RTSPConnection with TLS support
- GIO TLS bindings
- MainLoop integration for async TLS

## Risk Mitigation
- Default to strict certificate validation
- Comprehensive error messages for TLS failures
- Support both TLS 1.2 and 1.3
- Add TLS debugging property for troubleshooting

## Confidence Score: 8/10
Well-defined TLS API in RTSPConnection. Solves current Send+Sync issues with native integration.
