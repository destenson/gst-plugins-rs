# PRP: Research rtspsrc2 Architecture Redesign Options

## Problem Statement

While the immediate fixes address critical data flow issues, rtspsrc2 may benefit from architectural improvements to match the robustness and performance of the original rtspsrc. This research PRP will identify long-term architectural improvements.

## Context & Research

### Current Architecture Assessment
rtspsrc2 uses an AppSrc-based architecture:
- **AppSrc elements** for RTP/RTCP data injection
- **Ghost pads** for external interface
- **Async tasks** for network I/O
- **rtpbin integration** for RTP processing

### Original rtspsrc Architecture
Needs analysis of how original rtspsrc achieves better robustness:
- **Internal pipeline structure**
- **Pad management approach** 
- **Data flow patterns**
- **Integration with rtpbin**

## Research Goals

### Goal 1: Analyze Original rtspsrc Architecture
- **File**: `C:\Users\deste\repos\gstreamer\subprojects\gst-plugins-good\gst\rtsp\gstrtspsrc.c`
- **Focus**: Internal structure, pad management, data flow
- **Document**: Key architectural decisions and patterns
- **Compare**: With current rtspsrc2 approach

### Goal 2: Evaluate AppSrc vs Direct Pad Approach
- **Question**: Is AppSrc the right abstraction for RTP data injection?
- **Alternatives**: Direct pad creation, custom source elements
- **Trade-offs**: Complexity vs robustness vs performance
- **Recommendations**: Best approach for Rust implementation

### Goal 3: Research Async Integration Patterns
- **Issue**: GStreamer + tokio runtime conflicts in tests
- **Investigation**: How to properly integrate async networking with GStreamer
- **Patterns**: Used by other async GStreamer elements
- **Solutions**: Runtime isolation, different async approaches

### Goal 4: Identify Missing Features for Production Use
- **Reference**: `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - currently 14% feature parity
- **Priority**: Which missing features are critical for real-world use
- **Effort**: Estimate implementation complexity for key features
- **Roadmap**: Suggest implementation order

### Goal 5: Performance Analysis and Optimization Opportunities
- **Benchmarking**: Compare performance with original rtspsrc
- **Bottlenecks**: Identify potential performance issues
- **Memory**: Analyze memory usage patterns
- **Optimization**: Suggest improvements

### Goal 6: Error Handling and Robustness Review
- **Connection Recovery**: How to handle network interruptions
- **Server Compatibility**: Support for various RTSP server implementations
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual stream configurations, protocol variations
- **Resilience**: Recovery from various error conditions

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Code Analysis (2 hours)
- Deep dive into original rtspsrc implementation
- Document architecture patterns and key decisions
- Identify fundamental differences with rtspsrc2

### Phase 2: Experimental Validation (2 hours)  
- Create small test implementations of different approaches
- Validate async integration patterns
- Test alternative architectural choices

### Phase 3: Documentation and Recommendations (1 hour)
- Document findings and architectural options
- Provide specific recommendations for improvements
- Create roadmap for long-term development

## Deliverables

### Research Report
- **Architecture Comparison**: Detailed analysis of rtspsrc vs rtspsrc2
- **Recommendation Matrix**: Pros/cons of different approaches
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Suggested sequence for improvements
