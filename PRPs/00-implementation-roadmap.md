# Multi-Stream Recording and Inference System - Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview
A robust, production-grade Rust application that consolidates MediaMTX (RTSP proxy/WebRTC), Python DeepStream (inference), and control applications into a single unified system. The application will run as a systemd service with high availability, automatic recovery, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Total PRPs: 28
**Estimated Total Development Time: 56-112 hours** (2-4 hours per PRP)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (PRPs 1-5)
**Goal:** Establish project structure and core abstractions
- PRP-01: Project Structure and Cargo Workspace Setup
- PRP-02: Configuration Management Layer
- PRP-03: GStreamer Initialization and Plugin Discovery
- PRP-04: Pipeline Abstraction Layer
- PRP-05: Stream Source Management

**Dependencies:** None  
**Estimated Time:** 10-20 hours

### Phase 2: Stream Processing (PRPs 6-10)
**Goal:** Implement core streaming and recording functionality
- PRP-06: Stream Branching with Tee Element
- PRP-07: Recording Branch Implementation
- PRP-08: Inter-Pipeline Communication Setup
- PRP-09: Stream Manager Core Orchestration
- PRP-10: Stream Health Monitoring System

**Dependencies:** Phase 1  
**Estimated Time:** 10-20 hours

### Phase 3: Control Interface (PRPs 11-15)
**Goal:** Build REST API and real-time monitoring
- PRP-11: REST API Foundation
- PRP-12: Stream Control API Endpoints
- PRP-13: Metrics and Statistics Collection
- PRP-14: WebSocket Event Streaming
- PRP-15: Configuration Hot-Reload System

**Dependencies:** Phase 2  
**Estimated Time:** 10-20 hours

### Phase 4: Storage and Resilience (PRPs 16-20)
**Goal:** Implement robust storage management and persistence
- PRP-16: Storage Management and Disk Monitoring
- PRP-17: Disk Rotation and Hot-Swap Support
- PRP-18: Systemd Service Integration
- PRP-19: Error Recovery and Resilience
- PRP-20: State Persistence and Database Integration

**Dependencies:** Phase 3  
**Estimated Time:** 10-20 hours

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (PRPs 21-24)
**Goal:** Add inference and enterprise features
- PRP-21: NVIDIA Inference Branch Implementation
- PRP-22: CPU Inference Fallback Implementation
- PRP-23: Telemetry and Distributed Tracing
- PRP-24: Backup and Disaster Recovery

**Dependencies:** Phase 4  
**Estimated Time:** 8-16 hours

### Phase 6: Streaming Servers (PRPs 25-28)
**Goal:** Implement RTSP and WebRTC server functionality
- PRP-25: RTSP Server and Proxy Implementation
- PRP-26: WebRTC Server Implementation
- PRP-27: WHIP/WHEP Protocol Support
- PRP-28: Integration Testing and Validation Framework

**Dependencies:** Phase 4 (can parallel with Phase 5)  
**Estimated Time:** 8-16 hours

## Critical Path
1. **Foundation First:** PRPs 1-5 must be completed first
2. **Core Functionality:** PRPs 6-9 are critical for basic operation
3. **API Early:** PRP 11-12 enable testing and control
4. **Storage Critical:** PRP 16 needed before production
5. **Service Integration:** PRP 18 required for deployment

## Parallel Development Opportunities
- Phase 5 (Inference) and Phase 6 (Streaming Servers) can be developed in parallel
- PRPs 13-15 (Metrics, WebSocket, Hot-reload) can be developed independently
- PRPs 21-22 (GPU/CPU inference) can be developed by separate developers

## Risk Areas and Mitigation

### High Risk PRPs (Confidence Score < 7/10)
- **PRP-17: Disk Rotation (6/10)** - Complex OS-level integration
  - Mitigation: Start with manual rotation, add auto-detection later
  
- **PRP-21: NVIDIA Inference (6/10)** - DeepStream complexity
  - Mitigation: Start with simple models, extensive testing
  
- **PRP-25: RTSP Server (6/10)** - Complex protocol implementation
  - Mitigation: Use gst-rtsp-server, extensive client testing
  
- **PRP-26: WebRTC Server (5/10)** - Complex signaling and NAT traversal
  - Mitigation: Start with local network, add TURN later

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Each PRP includes unit test requirements
- **Integration Tests:** PRP-28 provides comprehensive testing
- **Load Testing:** Included in PRP-28
- **Failure Testing:** Covered in PRPs 19 and 28

## Deployment Path
1. **Development:** Docker container with docker-compose
2. **Staging:** Systemd service on test servers
3. **Production:** High-availability deployment with monitoring

## Success Metrics
- ✅ All 28 PRPs implemented and tested
- ✅ System handles 100+ concurrent streams
- ✅ Automatic recovery from failures
- ✅ < 100ms latency for WebRTC streaming
- ✅ 99.9% uptime target
- ✅ Zero data loss during disk rotation

## Technology Stack
- **Core:** Rust, GStreamer, gst-plugins-rs
- **API:** Actix-Web, WebSocket
- **Database:** SQLite with sqlx
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, OpenTelemetry
- **Inference:** NVIDIA DeepStream, ONNX Runtime
- **Protocols:** RTSP, WebRTC, WHIP/WHEP

## Documentation Requirements
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Deployment guide
- Configuration reference
- Troubleshooting guide
- Performance tuning guide

## Post-Implementation Considerations
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Helm charts for cloud deployment
- Multi-region support
- Horizontal scaling strategy
- Backup automation scripts

## Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to building a robust, production-grade streaming system. The modular PRP structure allows for incremental development, parallel work streams, and clear validation gates at each step.

**Total Estimated Timeline:** 4-8 weeks with 1-2 developers
