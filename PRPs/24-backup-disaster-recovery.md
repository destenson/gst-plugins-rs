# PRP-24: Backup and Disaster Recovery

## Overview
Implement backup strategies and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and service continuity.

## Context
- Recording data is critical
- Configuration must be preserved
- Need rapid recovery capability
- Should handle catastrophic failures

## Requirements
1. Create backup system for recordings
2. Implement configuration backups
3. Add database backup strategy
4. Create recovery procedures
5. Implement data verification

<!-- ## Implementation Tasks
1. Create src/backup/mod.rs module
2. Define BackupManager struct:
   - Backup schedules
   - Backup destinations
   - Retention policies
   - Recovery state
3. Implement recording backup:
   - Identify completed segments
   - Copy to backup location
   - Verify integrity
   - Update backup catalog
4. Add configuration backup:
   - Version control integration
   - Automatic snapshots
   - Diff tracking
   - Rollback capability
5. Create database backup:
   - SQLite backup API
   - Point-in-time snapshots
   - Incremental backups
   - Off-site replication -->
6. Implement recovery procedures:
   - Detect corruption
   - Restore from backup
   - Rebuild state
   - Resume operations
7. Add verification system:
   - Checksum validation
   - Test restores
   - Backup integrity checks
   - Alert on failures

## Validation Gates
```bash
# Test backup operations
cargo test --package stream-manager backup::tests

# Verify recovery procedures
cargo test disaster_recovery

# Check backup integrity
cargo test backup_verification
```

## Dependencies
- PRP-20: Database to backup
- PRP-16: Storage management

## References
- SQLite backup: https://www.sqlite.org/backup.html
- Rsync for files: Standard rsync patterns
- Checksum verification: SHA256 or xxHash

## Success Metrics
- Backups created on schedule
- Recovery procedures work
- Data integrity maintained
- Minimal data loss window

**Confidence Score: 7/10**
