# PRP-007: CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Debian Package Building

## Overview
Integrate Debian package building into the existing CI/CD pipeline to automatically generate and publish packages for releases and tagged versions.

## Context
- Repository uses GitLab CI (see .gitlab-ci.yml)
- Need to build packages for multiple architectures
- Should publish to package repository or releases
- Integrate with existing test infrastructure

## References
- GitLab CI documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/
- GitHub Actions for Debian: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-debian-package
- Package publishing: https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Setup

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create .gitlab-ci.yml job for Debian package building
2. Add multi-architecture build matrix
3. Configure artifact storage for built packages
4. Implement version tagging from git tags
5. Add package signing configuration
6. Set up release publishing workflow
7. Create GitHub Actions workflow alternative
8. Add package repository publishing step

## Validation Gates
```yaml
# Example CI job structure
build-deb:
  stage: package
  script:
    - cargo install cargo-c cargo-deb
    - cd utils/fallbackswitch
    - cargo deb
    - lintian target/debian/*.deb
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - utils/fallbackswitch/target/debian/*.deb
```

## Success Criteria
- CI builds packages on every tag/release
- Packages are available as CI artifacts
- Multi-architecture builds complete successfully
- Package versioning matches git tags
- Automated testing runs before package creation
- Published packages are accessible to users

## CI/CD Configuration
```
Stages:
1. Test - Run existing tests
2. Build - Compile the plugin
3. Package - Create Debian packages
4. Test Package - Validate packages
5. Publish - Upload to repository/releases
```

## Dependencies
- CI runner with Docker support
- cargo-deb in CI environment
- Package signing keys (for production)
- Repository hosting for packages

## Notes
- Consider using Docker images for consistent builds
- Cache Rust dependencies for faster builds
- Implement both GitLab CI and GitHub Actions
- Add badges to README for package status
- Consider nightly builds for development versions

## Confidence Score: 7/10
CI/CD integration requires coordination with existing infrastructure but patterns are clear.
