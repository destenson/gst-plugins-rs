# PRP-36: Inference Performance Optimization

## Overview
Optimize the CPU inference pipeline for performance through frame skipping, multithreading, caching, and hardware acceleration features to achieve real-time processing capabilities.

## Context
- CPU inference is inherently slower than GPU
- Need to maximize throughput for real-time video
- Frame skipping can reduce load
- Parallel processing can improve throughput
- Modern CPUs have vector instructions (AVX, NEON)

## Requirements
1. Implement intelligent frame skipping
2. Add multi-threaded inference
3. Optimize memory allocation
4. Enable SIMD optimizations
5. Implement result caching

## Implementation Tasks
1. Implement frame skipping logic:
   - Use inference-interval property
   - Smart skipping based on motion
   - Interpolate results between frames
   - Maintain temporal consistency
   - Configurable skip strategies

2. Add parallel processing:
   - Create inference thread pool
   - Pipeline preprocessing and inference
   - Async inference execution
   - Queue management for frames
   - Load balancing across cores

3. Optimize memory management:
   - Reuse allocated buffers
   - Memory pool for tensors
   - Zero-copy where possible
   - Reduce allocation overhead
   - Optimize cache locality

4. Enable CPU optimizations:
   - Enable AVX/AVX2 for x86
   - Enable NEON for ARM
   - Optimize data layout
   - Vectorize preprocessing
   - Profile and optimize hot paths

5. Implement result caching:
   - Cache recent inference results
   - Similarity detection for frames
   - Perceptual hashing for comparison
   - Configurable cache size
   - Cache invalidation strategies
