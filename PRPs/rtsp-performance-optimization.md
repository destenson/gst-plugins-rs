# PRP: Performance Optimization with Native Bindings

## Overview
Optimize performance by leveraging native RTSPConnection's efficient buffer management, zero-copy operations, and optimized protocol handling.

## Background
The native RTSPConnection is optimized for performance with careful buffer management, minimal allocations, and efficient protocol parsing. Moving from Tokio to native implementation can improve performance and reduce memory usage.

## Requirements
- Reduce memory allocations in message handling
- Optimize buffer management for RTP packets
- Improve latency for live streams
- Reduce CPU usage in protocol handling
- Maintain or improve throughput

## Technical Context
Performance improvements available:
- RTSPConnection's optimized message parsing
- Zero-copy buffer passing where possible
- Native keep-alive reduces overhead
- GIO's efficient event dispatching
- Reduced context switching without Tokio

Current performance bottlenecks:
- Message allocation and copying
- Tokio runtime overhead
- Multiple buffer copies in data path
- Async task scheduling overhead

## Implementation Tasks
1. Profile current implementation for baseline
2. Implement zero-copy message passing
3. Use RTSPConnection's buffer pooling
4. Optimize RTP packet handling path
5. Reduce allocations in hot paths
6. Implement efficient event batching
7. Use GIO's scatter-gather I/O
8. Optimize RTCP packet aggregation
9. Implement lazy message parsing
10. Add performance metrics collection

## Testing Approach
- Benchmark message throughput
- Measure latency for live streams
- Profile memory allocations
- CPU usage under load testing

## Validation Gates
```bash
# Build optimized version
cargo build --package gst-plugin-rtsp --release --no-default-features

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench --package gst-plugin-rtsp

# Memory profiling
valgrind --tool=massif cargo test --package gst-plugin-rtsp performance

# CPU profiling
perf record -g cargo test --package gst-plugin-rtsp stress
perf report
```

## Success Metrics
- 20% reduction in memory allocations
- 15% reduction in CPU usage
- <5ms added latency for live streams
- Improved throughput for high-bitrate streams

## Dependencies
- RTSPConnection with native optimizations
- GIO efficient I/O operations
- Completion of basic migration PRPs

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain performance benchmarks
- Profile before and after each change
- Keep optimization changes isolated
- Test with various stream types/bitrates

## Confidence Score: 7/10
Significant performance gains possible but requires careful profiling and testing.
