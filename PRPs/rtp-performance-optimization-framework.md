# PRP: RTP Performance Optimization Framework

## Problem Statement

Establish a comprehensive performance optimization framework for the Rust RTP implementation to achieve and exceed the performance of the original C implementation. The research identified ~30% performance gap and 50-100% optimization potential through zero-copy techniques, SIMD operations, and advanced buffer management. This framework provides the foundation for systematic performance improvement.

## Context & Requirements

### Performance Gap Analysis
From the RTP Architecture Research Report:
- **Current Rust Performance**: ~50,000 packets/second, 20μs latency, 2KB overhead
- **Original C Performance**: ~80,000 packets/second, 15μs latency, 1.5KB overhead  
- **Optimization Potential**: 100,000+ packets/second with zero-copy and SIMD techniques

### Optimization Opportunities Identified
1. **Buffer Pool Management**: Eliminate allocation overhead
2. **Zero-Copy Paths**: Minimize memory copies in packet construction
3. **SIMD Optimization**: Vectorized RTP header processing
4. **Memory-Mapped I/O**: Efficient buffer management for high throughput

### Reference Implementation Patterns
Study existing optimization patterns in codebase:
- Look at `net/rtp/src/poc_rtp_alternatives.rs` for optimization examples
- Reference performance patterns from `net/rtsp/src/rtspsrc/` for async optimization
- Examine buffer management in `net/rtp/src/basepay/mod.rs` and `net/rtp/src/basedepay/mod.rs`

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Measurement Methodology
- Use statistical benchmarking with multiple runs and confidence intervals
- Measure both throughput (packets/second) and latency (processing time)
- Include memory allocation profiling in performance assessment
- Compare against consistent C implementation baseline

### Optimization Implementation Strategy
- Start with buffer pool optimization for immediate gains
- Implement zero-copy paths for common scenarios first
- Add SIMD optimizations incrementally with feature gates
- Maintain fallback paths for platforms without optimizations

### Integration Considerations
- Design optimization layers as opt-in features
- Maintain API compatibility with existing implementations
- Provide clear performance improvement documentation
- Enable/disable optimizations based on workload characteristics

### Safety and Correctness
- Ensure all optimizations maintain Rust memory safety guarantees
- Comprehensive testing of optimization paths for correctness
- Performance optimizations must not introduce functional regressions
- Clear documentation of optimization assumptions and constraints

This PRP establishes the essential performance optimization foundation for achieving and exceeding C implementation performance in the Rust RTP framework.

## Confidence Score: 9/10

Very high confidence based on well-understood optimization techniques, clear measurement criteria, and existing patterns in the codebase. The focused scope on infrastructure makes this highly achievable.
