# PRP: GIO-Based Async I/O Implementation

## Overview
Implement all async I/O operations using GIO's async patterns, completely replacing Tokio's async/await with GIO callbacks and GLib MainContext integration.

## Background
GIO provides comprehensive async I/O through callback-based APIs that integrate naturally with GStreamer's event system. This eliminates the need for a separate async runtime and reduces overhead.

## Requirements
- Replace Tokio async functions with GIO async operations
- Implement callback-based async patterns
- Use GIO cancellables for operation cancellation  
- Integrate with GLib MainContext for event dispatching
- Maintain performance parity with Tokio implementation

## Technical Context
GIO async patterns:
- Async operations with callbacks: `*_async()` and `*_finish()`
- `gio::Cancellable` for cancellation
- `gio::AsyncResult` for operation results
- MainContext integration for dispatch
- Priority-based source scheduling

Tokio patterns to replace:
- async/await functions
- tokio::select! for concurrent operations
- JoinHandle for task management
- Channels for inter-task communication

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create GIO async wrapper utilities
2. Implement async read operations with gio::InputStream
3. Implement async write with gio::OutputStream  
4. Create callback management infrastructure
5. Implement cancellation propagation system
6. Build select-like functionality with GSource priorities
7. Replace async channels with GIO async queues
8. Implement timeout sources with g_timeout_add
9. Create error propagation through callbacks
10. Build async operation chaining utilities

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests for each async operation
- Cancellation testing under load
- Callback ordering verification
- Memory leak testing with valgrind

## Validation Gates
```bash
# Build without Tokio
cargo build --package gst-plugin-rtsp --no-default-features

# Run async I/O tests
cargo test --package gst-plugin-rtsp gio_async

# Stress test async operations
cargo test --package gst-plugin-rtsp async_stress

# Check for memory leaks
valgrind --leak-check=full cargo test --package gst-plugin-rtsp
```

## Success Metrics
- All async operations complete successfully
- Proper cancellation of pending operations
- No memory leaks in callback chains
- Performance within 10% of Tokio implementation

## Dependencies
- GIO bindings with async support
- GLib MainContext integration
- RTSPConnection async methods

## Risk Mitigation
- Create comprehensive callback wrapper library
- Use RAII for automatic cleanup
- Extensive testing of edge cases
- Clear callback ownership documentation

## Confidence Score: 7/10
Significant paradigm shift from futures to callbacks. Well-established patterns but complex migration.
