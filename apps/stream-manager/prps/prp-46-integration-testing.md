# PRP-46: Web UI Integration Testing and Polish

## Overview
Final integration, testing, and polish phase for the complete web interface, ensuring all components work together seamlessly.

## Context
- All individual components have been built
- Need end-to-end testing
- Performance optimization required
- Final polish and bug fixes
- Uses Deno for frontend tooling

## Requirements
1. End-to-end test suite
2. Performance optimization
3. Accessibility compliance
4. Browser compatibility
5. Security review
6. Bundle optimization
7. Error tracking setup
8. Analytics integration
9. Final UI polish

## Implementation Tasks
1. Setup Playwright for E2E testing
2. Create comprehensive test scenarios
3. Implement performance monitoring
4. Run accessibility audit and fixes
5. Test across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
6. Perform security audit
7. Optimize bundle size and splitting
8. Setup error tracking (Sentry or similar)
9. Add analytics (privacy-respecting)
10. Polish UI animations and transitions
11. Create loading states for all async operations
12. Implement proper error boundaries
13. Add user preference persistence
14. Final responsive design review

## Test Scenarios
- Complete user journey from login to stream management
- Stream creation, monitoring, and deletion
- Recording management workflow
- Configuration changes and hot reload
- Real-time updates and WebSocket stability
- Mobile user experience
- Offline mode functionality
- Performance under load
