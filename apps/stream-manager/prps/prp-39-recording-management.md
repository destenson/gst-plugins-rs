# PRP-39: Recording Management Interface

## Overview
Create a comprehensive recording management interface for browsing, playing back, and managing recorded streams.

## Context
- Recordings are stored as segmented files
- Need to browse by date/time and stream
- Playback of recorded segments
- Download and delete capabilities
- Storage management features

## Requirements
1. Recording browser with calendar view
2. Timeline view for recordings
3. Playback player with controls
4. Download individual or bulk files
5. Delete with confirmation
6. Storage usage visualization
7. Search and filter recordings
8. Thumbnail generation
9. Recording metadata display

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create RecordingList page component
2. Implement calendar date picker
3. Create timeline visualization component
4. Add recording table with details
5. Implement video player for playback
6. Add download functionality (single/bulk)
7. Create delete confirmation modal
8. Implement storage usage charts
9. Add search by stream name/date
10. Create thumbnail preview on hover
11. Add recording metadata panel
12. Implement continuous playback across segments
13. Create export to external storage option
14. Add recording retention policy display

## Page Components
- Calendar picker (select date range)
- Timeline view (visual recording blocks)
- Recording table (sortable list)
- Player modal (playback with controls)
- Storage widget (usage by stream)
- Bulk actions toolbar
- Filter panel (stream, date, size)

## Resources
- React Calendar: https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-calendar
- Timeline component: https://github.com/namespace-ee/react-timeline-9000
- Video.js for playback: https://videojs.com/
- File download: https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/

## Validation Gates
```bash
cd apps/stream-manager/web-ui

# Run development server
deno run dev

# Test recording features:
# 1. Calendar shows dates with recordings
# 2. Timeline displays recording segments
# 3. Click recording opens player
# 4. Player plays back recording smoothly
# 5. Download creates valid file
# 6. Delete removes recording after confirmation
# 7. Storage chart shows correct usage
# 8. Search filters results correctly

# Run tests
deno test

# Type checking
deno run type-check
```

## Success Criteria
- Recording list loads and displays all recordings
- Calendar highlights dates with recordings
- Timeline shows recording segments accurately
- Playback works across multiple segments
- Download provides valid video files
- Delete operations require confirmation
- Storage visualization is accurate
- Search and filters work correctly
- Mobile view is functional

## Dependencies
- PRP-32 (Base layout) must be completed
- PRP-33 (API client) must be completed
- PRP-38 (Stream detail) recommended for player component reuse

## Storage Considerations
- Implement pagination for large recording lists
- Lazy load thumbnails
- Stream video files rather than full download
- Cache recording metadata

## Estimated Effort
4 hours

## Confidence Score
7/10 - Complex UI with timeline and video playback challenges
