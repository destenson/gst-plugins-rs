# PRP-43: Notifications and Alert System

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive notification system for displaying alerts, warnings, and informational messages with configurable alert rules.

## Context
- Events come from WebSocket connection
- Need toast notifications and alert center
- Configurable alert thresholds
- Browser notifications support
- Uses Deno for frontend tooling

## Requirements
1. Toast notifications for immediate alerts
2. Notification center with history
3. Alert configuration interface
4. Browser push notifications
5. Sound alerts (optional)
6. Alert acknowledgment
7. Notification filtering
8. Alert severity levels
9. Custom alert rules

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create notification context and provider
2. Implement toast notification component
3. Create notification center panel
4. Add browser notification permission request
5. Implement alert rule configuration UI
6. Create notification sound system
7. Add notification persistence
8. Implement notification grouping
9. Create alert acknowledgment system
10. Add notification preferences per user
11. Implement alert escalation logic
12. Create notification export functionality
13. Add do-not-disturb mode
14. Implement notification templates

## Alert Types
- System: Service health, resource usage
- Stream: Connection lost, quality degraded
- Recording: Storage full, write errors
- Security: Authentication failures, suspicious activity
- Maintenance: Updates available, scheduled downtime

## Resources
- React Hot Toast: https://react-hot-toast.com/
- Browser Notifications API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API
- React-toastify: https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/
- Push notifications: https://web.dev/push-notifications-overview/

## Validation Gates
```bash
cd apps/stream-manager/web-ui

# Using Deno
deno task dev

# Test notification features:
# 1. Toast notifications appear for events
# 2. Notification center shows history
# 3. Browser notifications work (after permission)
# 4. Alert rules trigger correctly
# 5. Sound alerts play (if enabled)
# 6. Acknowledgment marks as read
# 7. Filtering reduces notification list
# 8. Do-not-disturb mode silences alerts

# Run tests with Deno
deno task test

# Test with mock events
deno task test:notifications
```

## Success Criteria
- Toast notifications display correctly
- Notification center maintains history
- Browser notifications work when permitted
- Alert rules trigger based on conditions
- Notifications can be acknowledged/dismissed
- Preferences persist across sessions
- Mobile notifications work properly
- Performance remains good with many notifications

## Dependencies
- PRP-34 (WebSocket client) must be completed
- PRP-35 (Authentication) must be completed
- PRP-36 (Dashboard) recommended for integration

## Accessibility Considerations
- Screen reader announcements for alerts
- Keyboard navigation for notification center
- High contrast mode support
- Configurable notification duration

## Estimated Effort
3 hours

## Confidence Score
8/10 - Standard notification patterns with good library support
