# PRP-09: Stream Manager Core Orchestration

## Overview
Implement the core StreamManager that orchestrates all stream sources, branches, and pipelines with centralized lifecycle management.

## Context
- Central coordinator for all stream operations
- Must manage multiple concurrent streams
- Need thread-safe access from API
- Should handle graceful shutdown

## Requirements
1. Create main StreamManager struct
2. Implement stream registry with Arc/RwLock
3. Add stream lifecycle methods
4. Setup central event handling
5. Implement graceful shutdown

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create src/manager/mod.rs module
2. Define StreamManager struct:
   - Arc<RwLock<HashMap>> for streams
   - Main pipeline reference
   - Configuration reference
   - Shutdown signal channel
3. Define ManagedStream struct:
   - Stream ID
   - Source component
   - Branch manager
   - Health monitor
   - Statistics
4. Implement stream operations:
   - add_stream() with configuration
   - remove_stream() with cleanup
   - get_stream() for queries
   - list_streams() for enumeration
5. Add lifecycle management:
   - Initialize main pipeline
   - Start all components
   - Stop with grace period
   - Force shutdown if needed
6. Setup event aggregation:
   - Collect events from all streams
   - Forward to monitoring system
7. Implement Drop for cleanup

## Validation Gates
```bash
# Test stream manager creation
cargo test --package stream-manager manager::tests

# Verify stream operations
cargo test stream_add_remove

# Check concurrent access
cargo test concurrent_stream_access
```

## Dependencies
- PRP-05: Stream source management
- PRP-06: Branch management
- PRP-07: Recording branch

## References
- Arc/RwLock patterns: Search for "Arc<RwLock" in codebase
- HashMap usage: Standard Rust patterns
- Shutdown patterns: tokio graceful shutdown docs

## Success Metrics
- Multiple streams managed concurrently
- Thread-safe access works
- Clean shutdown of all streams
- No resource leaks
