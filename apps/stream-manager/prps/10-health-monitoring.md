# PRP-10: Stream Health Monitoring System

## Overview
Implement comprehensive health monitoring for streams with automatic detection of failures and unhealthy states.

## Context
- Must detect stalled streams quickly
- Need to track retry patterns
- Should identify streams for removal
- Must provide health metrics

## Requirements
1. Create health monitoring subsystem
2. Define health states and thresholds
3. Implement periodic health checks
4. Add automatic unhealthy stream detection
5. Create health event notifications

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create src/health/monitor.rs module
2. Define HealthState enum:
   - Healthy
   - Degraded (high retries)
   - Unhealthy (no frames)
   - Failed (unrecoverable)
3. Define HealthMonitor struct:
   - Stream reference
   - Last frame timestamp
   - Retry statistics
   - Health state
   - Threshold configuration
4. Implement health checking:
   - Check frame timestamps
   - Monitor retry counts
   - Track buffering percentage
   - Evaluate against thresholds
5. Create monitoring task:
   - Periodic check interval
   - Iterate all streams
   - Update health states
   - Trigger state change events
6. Add health events:
   - Stream became unhealthy
   - Stream recovered
   - Stream marked for removal
7. Implement auto-removal logic based on config

## Validation Gates
```bash
# Test health monitoring
cargo test --package stream-manager health::monitor::tests

# Verify state transitions
cargo test health_state_changes

# Check auto-removal logic
cargo test unhealthy_stream_removal
```

## Dependencies
- PRP-09: StreamManager for stream access
- PRP-05: Stream source for statistics

## References
- Health patterns: fallbacksrc statistics monitoring
- Tokio intervals: tokio::time::interval documentation
- Event patterns: Search for "event" in codebase

## Success Metrics
- Health states accurately reflect stream status
- Unhealthy streams detected within threshold
- Auto-removal works when configured
- Health events generated correctly
