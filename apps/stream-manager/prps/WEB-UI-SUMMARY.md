## Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: Deno, Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend Integration**: actix-web, WebSocket
- **Default Port**: 8080 (configurable)
- **Testing**: Playwright, Vitest
- **Build Tool**: Deno (instead of npm)

## Implementation Notes

### Deno Usage
All PRPs have been updated to use Deno instead of npm:
- `deno task dev` for development
- `deno task build` for production build
- `deno task test` for testing
- `deno install` for dependencies

### Port Configuration
- Backend default port changed from 3000 to 8080
- Port is configurable via environment variables
- Frontend proxies API calls during development

### Progressive Development
Each PRP builds upon previous ones, creating a fully functional feature at each step. The application remains usable throughout development, with features being added incrementally.

### Mobile-First Approach
While building desktop-first for productivity, all components are designed with mobile responsiveness in mind from the start.

## Success Metrics
- Lighthouse scores > 90 in all categories
- Support for 100+ concurrent streams
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Real-time updates with < 100ms latency
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Works on all major browsers and devices

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve PRPs
2. Set up development environment with Deno
3. Begin implementation with PRP-30
4. Follow the phased approach for systematic development
5. Conduct testing after each phase
