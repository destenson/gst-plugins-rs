# Test mobile features:
# 1. Test on real mobile devices
# 2. PWA installs correctly
# 3. Offline mode shows cached content
# 4. Touch gestures work smoothly
# 5. Navigation is accessible with thumb
# 6. Images load progressively
# 7. Performance score > 90 in Lighthouse
# 8. Works in portrait and landscape

# Run Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse http://localhost:4173 --view

# Test with device emulation
# Chrome DevTools -> Device Mode
```

## Success Criteria
- PWA scores 100 in Lighthouse PWA audit
- Touch interactions feel native
- Pages load in < 3 seconds on 3G
- Offline mode provides useful functionality
- App can be installed from browser
- Navigation works one-handed
- No horizontal scrolling on mobile
- Text is readable without zooming

## Dependencies
- All previous UI PRPs should be completed
- Components should be mobile-aware

## Performance Targets
- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive < 3.5s
- Bundle size < 200KB (gzipped)
- Lighthouse Performance Score > 90

## Estimated Effort
4 hours

## Confidence Score
8/10 - PWA setup is well-documented, responsive design requires testing
