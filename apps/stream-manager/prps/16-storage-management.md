# PRP-16: Storage Management and Disk Monitoring

## Overview
Implement robust storage management with disk space monitoring, automatic cleanup, and multi-path support for recording distribution.

## Context
- Must handle disk full scenarios gracefully
- Need automatic old file cleanup
- Should support multiple storage paths
- Must detect disk failures

## Requirements
1. Create storage management subsystem
2. Implement disk space monitoring
3. Add automatic cleanup policies
4. Support multiple storage paths
5. Handle disk failure detection

## Implementation Tasks
1. Create src/storage/manager.rs module
2. Define StorageManager struct:
   - Storage paths configuration
   - Usage statistics per path
   - Cleanup policies
   - Path health status
3. Implement disk monitoring:
   - Check available space periodically
   - Track usage per stream
   - Calculate growth rates
   - Predict space exhaustion
4. Create cleanup policies:
   - Age-based deletion
   - Size-based limits
   - Keep minimum segments
   - Priority-based retention
5. Add multi-path support:
   - Round-robin distribution
   - Least-used selection
   - Path affinity per stream
   - Failover on path failure
6. Implement path health checks:
   - Test write permissions
   - Check mount status
   - Verify path accessibility
   - Detect removed drives
7. Add storage events and alerts

## Validation Gates
```bash
# Test storage management
cargo test --package stream-manager storage::manager::tests

# Verify cleanup policies
cargo test storage_cleanup

# Check multi-path handling
cargo test storage_multipath
```

## Dependencies
- PRP-07: Recording branch creates files
- PRP-13: Metrics for storage monitoring

## References
- Disk space checks: std::fs and sysinfo crate
- Cleanup patterns: Search for file rotation examples
- Path management: Standard filesystem operations

## Success Metrics
- Disk usage monitored accurately
- Cleanup triggers at thresholds
- Multiple paths utilized
- Disk failures handled gracefully
