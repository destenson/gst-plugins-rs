PRP-27: WHIP/WHEP Protocol Support - COMPLETED

Implementation Summary:
- Implemented WHIP (WebRTC-HTTP Ingestion Protocol) for stream ingestion
- Implemented WHEP (WebRTC-HTTP Egress Protocol) for stream playback
- Added HTTP-based SDP negotiation
- Integrated Bearer token authentication
- Created session management for both protocols
- Added ICE trickle support via PATCH endpoints
- Implemented DELETE endpoints for session teardown

Files Created/Modified:
- src/webrtc/whip_whep.rs - Core WHIP/WHEP handler implementation
- src/webrtc/mod.rs - Added exports for WHIP/WHEP components
- src/api/routes.rs - Integrated WHIP/WHEP endpoints
- src/api/mod.rs - Added WhipWhepHandler to AppState

Features Implemented:
✓ WHIP ingestion via POST /whip/{stream_id}
✓ WHEP playback via POST /whep/{stream_id}
✓ SDP offer/answer negotiation
✓ Bearer token authentication
✓ Session resource management
✓ DELETE endpoints for teardown
✓ PATCH endpoints for ICE trickle
✓ 201 Created response with Location header
✓ Session tracking and lifecycle management

Protocol Compliance:
- Follows WHIP draft specification (draft-ietf-wish-whip)
- Follows WHEP draft specification (draft-murillo-whep)
- Returns proper HTTP status codes
- Implements required HTTP headers
- Supports ICE trickle via application/trickle-ice-sdpfrag

Tests Created:
- Handler creation test
- Authentication token validation test
- ICE candidate parsing test
- SDP answer generation test

Current Limitations (for future PRPs):
- Using test video source instead of actual stream integration
- Basic SDP generation (production would use webrtcbin)
- No TURN server configuration yet
- No bandwidth adaptation

Integration Points:
- Ready to connect with stream manager for actual streams
- Can be extended for recording branch integration
- Prepared for inference pipeline connection

The WHIP/WHEP implementation provides standards-compliant WebRTC streaming via HTTP.
