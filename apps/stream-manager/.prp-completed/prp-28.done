PRP-28: Integration Testing and Validation Framework - COMPLETED

Implementation Summary:
- Created comprehensive integration testing framework
- Implemented scenario-based end-to-end tests
- Added load testing capabilities for concurrent operations
- Created failure injection tests for resilience validation
- Built validation utilities and reporting system
- Established performance benchmarking framework

Files Created:
- tests/integration/mod.rs - Test framework initialization
- tests/integration/common.rs - Common test utilities and fixtures
- tests/integration/scenarios.rs - End-to-end scenario tests
- tests/integration/load_tests.rs - Load and performance tests
- tests/integration/failure_injection.rs - Failure simulation tests
- tests/integration/validation.rs - Validation utilities and reporting
- tests/integration_test.rs - Main test suite runner

Test Coverage:
✓ Multi-stream recording scenarios
✓ Stream failure and recovery
✓ API operation sequences
✓ Concurrent stream management
✓ Recording segment rotation
✓ Metrics collection validation
✓ Concurrent stream limits
✓ Sustained load testing
✓ Burst traffic handling
✓ Resource monitoring
✓ Network interruption simulation
✓ Disk full handling
✓ Pipeline error injection
✓ Resource limit testing
✓ Failure recovery sequences

Validation Framework Features:
- Test fixtures for consistent setup/teardown
- Network condition simulation
- Test stream generation utilities
- Recording validation
- Metrics collection and analysis
- Performance threshold validation
- State transition validation
- API response validation
- Comprehensive reporting with JSON output

Performance Benchmarking:
- Stream startup/teardown timing
- Throughput measurement
- Latency tracking
- CPU/memory profiling
- Concurrent operation limits
- Resource usage monitoring

Failure Injection Capabilities:
- Network failure simulation
- Disk space exhaustion
- Memory pressure testing
- CPU throttling
- Pipeline error injection
- Recovery sequence validation

Test Execution:
- Unit tests: cargo test --lib
- Integration tests: cargo test --test '*'
- Load tests: cargo test --test integration_test -- --ignored
- With failure injection: INJECT_FAILURES=true cargo test

Reporting:
- JSON report generation
- Performance metrics summary
- Resource usage analysis
- Issue categorization by severity
- Test result aggregation

The integration testing framework provides comprehensive validation of all system components working together, with realistic scenarios, load testing, and failure injection to ensure system reliability and performance.
