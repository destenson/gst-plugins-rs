PRP-16: Storage Management and Disk Monitoring
===============================================
Completed: 2025-01-09
Status: ✅ Complete

## Implemented Components

### 1. Core Storage Manager (src/storage/manager.rs)
- StorageManager struct with multi-path support
- Configurable storage paths with priorities
- Usage statistics tracking per path
- Thread-safe state management with Arc<RwLock>

### 2. Disk Monitoring System
- Periodic space checking with configurable intervals
- Platform-specific disk usage detection:
  - Windows: GetDiskFreeSpaceExW via winapi
  - Unix: statvfs via nix crate
- Growth rate calculation and prediction
- Path health status monitoring

### 3. Cleanup Policies
- Age-based deletion with max_age_days
- Size-based limits with max_size_gb  
- Minimum segments retention per stream
- Priority-based retention for important streams
- Automatic cleanup trigger on thresholds

### 4. Multi-Path Support
- Four selection strategies:
  - RoundRobin: Cycle through available paths
  - LeastUsed: Select path with most free space
  - Priority: Use paths based on priority values
  - Affinity: Stream-specific path preferences
- Dynamic path addition/removal
- Path enable/disable functionality

### 5. Path Health Checks
- Write permission verification
- Mount status checking
- Path accessibility tests
- Automatic failover on path failure
- Recovery detection and notifications

### 6. Storage Event System
- Event types:
  - LowSpace(path, usage_percent)
  - PathUnavailable(path)
  - PathRecovered(path)
  - CleanupStarted
  - CleanupCompleted(files_deleted, bytes_freed)
  - StorageFull(path)
- Broadcast channel for event distribution
- Subscriber support for monitoring

### 7. Storage Configuration
- StorageConfig with paths and policies
- CleanupPolicy with retention rules
- Per-path usage limits
- Global storage constraints
- Stream affinity configuration

## Files Modified
- apps/stream-manager/Cargo.toml - Added platform dependencies
- apps/stream-manager/src/storage/mod.rs - Module exports
- apps/stream-manager/src/storage/manager.rs - Full implementation
- apps/stream-manager/src/lib.rs - StorageError integration
- apps/stream-manager/src/api/error.rs - Error conversion

## Validation Tests Passed
✅ test_storage_manager_creation
