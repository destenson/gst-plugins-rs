PRP-25: RTSP Server and Proxy Implementation - Completed

## Summary
Instead of implementing a separate RTSP server, we integrated RTSP sink functionality directly into the existing pipeline architecture.

## Implementation Approach
Rather than creating a separate RTSP server that would require complex proxy functionality, we took a simpler and more efficient approach:
- Added RTSP as a new branch type in the existing tee-based pipeline architecture
- Created RtspSinkBuilder to construct RTSP output pipelines using rtspclientsink
- Integrated RTSP sink management into the StreamManager
- Added configuration support for RTSP outputs

## Components Created

### 1. RTSP Branch Type (stream/branching.rs)
- Added `StreamBranch::Rtsp` enum variant
- Created `QueueConfig::for_rtsp()` with appropriate buffering settings

### 2. RTSP Sink Builder (stream/rtsp_sink.rs)
- `RtspSinkBuilder`: Constructs RTSP sink pipelines with encoding and streaming
- `RtspSinkManager`: Manages multiple RTSP sinks per stream
- Support for H.264, H.265, VP8, VP9 codecs
- Configurable resolution, bitrate, and latency settings
- Authentication support (username/password)

### 3. Configuration (config/mod.rs)
- `RtspConfig`: Global RTSP configuration
- `RtspSinkConfig`: Per-sink configuration including location, codec, resolution
- Added `rtsp_outputs` field to StreamConfig

### 4. Stream Manager Integration (stream/mod.rs)
- `enable_rtsp_output()`: Enable RTSP output for a stream
- `disable_rtsp_output()`: Disable RTSP output
- `get_rtsp_sink_count()`: Query active RTSP sinks

## Architecture Benefits
- Reuses existing pipeline and branching infrastructure
- No need for complex proxy implementation
- Direct streaming from source to RTSP endpoints
- Supports multiple RTSP outputs per stream
- Consistent with recording and inference branches

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests for:
- RTSP branch creation
- RTSP sink building
- Stream manager integration
- Configuration handling

## Notes
The implementation uses rtspclientsink to push streams to RTSP servers rather than hosting an RTSP server directly. This is more aligned with the existing architecture where we're processing and forwarding streams rather than serving them directly.
