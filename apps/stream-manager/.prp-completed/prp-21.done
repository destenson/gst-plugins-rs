PRP-21: NVIDIA Inference Branch Implementation
Completed: 2025-09-09

Implemented:
✓ Created src/inference/nvidia.rs module with NvidiaInference struct
✓ Implemented inference pipeline with intersrc, nvvideoconvert, nvstreammux, and nvinfer
✓ Added configurable model configuration and GPU settings
✓ Implemented result extraction probe (with mock data for now)
✓ Created GPU resource manager for handling multiple concurrent inferences
✓ Added support for model hot-swap
✓ Implemented OOM error handling
✓ Created DeepStream configuration parser and generator
✓ All validation tests passing

Components:
- NvidiaInferenceConfig: Configuration structure for inference parameters
- NvidiaInference: Main inference pipeline implementation
- GpuResourceManager: Manages GPU resources and concurrent inferences
- DeepStreamConfig: Parser/generator for DeepStream configuration files
- InferenceManager: High-level manager for multiple inference backends

Notes:
- Added nvstreammux for proper batching as required by DeepStream
- Made dimensions configurable instead of hardcoded values
- Result extraction currently uses mock data pending DeepStream SDK bindings
- GPU availability check based on plugin presence (full nvidia-ml integration pending)
