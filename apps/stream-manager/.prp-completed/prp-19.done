PRP-19: Error Recovery and Resilience - Completed

Implementation Summary:
- Created comprehensive error recovery framework with RecoveryManager
- Implemented circuit breaker pattern for preventing cascade failures
- Added exponential backoff strategies with jitter
- Created snapshot and rollback system for component state recovery
- Integrated recovery handlers for different component types
- Added resource health monitoring (memory, CPU)
- Implemented error classification (Transient, Recoverable, Fatal, Cascade)
- Added recovery policies and strategies
- Integrated with main application and service manager

Key Components:
- recovery/mod.rs: Main RecoveryManager implementation
- recovery/types.rs: Error types and recovery traits
- recovery/circuit_breaker.rs: Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- recovery/backoff.rs: Backoff strategies (exponential, linear, fibonacci)
- recovery/snapshot.rs: Component snapshot management

Validation:
- All recovery tests passing (36 tests)
- Circuit breaker tests passing (7 tests)
- Backoff strategy tests passing (9 tests)
- Snapshot management tests passing (9 tests)
- Error classification and handling tests passing
- Integration with main application successful
