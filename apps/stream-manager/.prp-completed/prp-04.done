PRP-04: Pipeline Abstraction Layer - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive pipeline abstraction layer with:

### Core Components
- **Pipeline Struct**: Enhanced wrapper around GStreamer pipeline with:
  - Unique UUID identification
  - State tracking with custom PipelineState enum
  - Message bus handling with async channel communication
  - Proper Drop trait implementation for cleanup

- **PipelineManager**: Multi-pipeline management system with:
  - HashMap-based pipeline registry using UUIDs
  - Async message forwarding system
  - Bulk operations (shutdown_all, list_pipelines)
  - Safe concurrent access with RwLock

### Key Features Implemented
1. **State Management**: 
   - Custom PipelineState enum (Null, Ready, Paused, Playing, Error)
   - Thread-safe state tracking with Mutex
   - Automatic state updates from GStreamer messages

2. **Message Bus Handling**:
   - Error, EOS, StateChanged, Buffering, and Info message processing
   - Async channel-based message forwarding
   - Pipeline-specific message routing with UUID tagging

3. **Lifecycle Methods**:
   - start(), pause(), stop() with proper error handling
   - add_element(), remove_element() helpers
   - Graceful cleanup on Drop

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Custom PipelineError type with thiserror
   - Integration with main StreamManagerError enum
   - Comprehensive error reporting

5. **Testing**:
   - Complete test suite covering all major functionality
   - Pipeline creation, state changes, cleanup, and message handling tests
   - All tests passing successfully

### Validation Results
✅ cargo check - No compilation errors
✅ cargo test pipeline - All 5 tests passed
✅ Proper memory management with Drop trait
✅ Message bus events processed correctly
✅ State changes handled properly
✅ No pipeline leaks on shutdown

## Files Modified
- src/pipeline/mod.rs - Complete rewrite with new abstractions
- src/lib.rs - Added Pipeline error types and exports
- Cargo.toml - Dependencies already in place (uuid, thiserror, tokio)

## Dependencies Satisfied
- PRP-03: GStreamer initialization ✅

## Success Metrics Met
- ✅ Pipelines created and destroyed cleanly
- ✅ State changes handled properly  
- ✅ Message bus events processed
- ✅ No pipeline leaks on shutdown
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Thread-safe concurrent operations
- ✅ UUID-based pipeline tracking

**Confidence Score: 9/10** (Excellent implementation with robust testing)
