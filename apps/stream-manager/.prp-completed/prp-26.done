PRP-26: WebRTC Server Implementation - COMPLETED

Implementation Summary:
- Created WebRTC server module with signaling support
- Implemented SDP offer/answer negotiation
- Added ICE candidate exchange handling
- Configured STUN/TURN server support
- Created peer connection management
- Integrated WebSocket signaling protocol
- Added REST API endpoints for WebRTC control
- Implemented peer state tracking

Files Created/Modified:
- src/webrtc/server.rs - Core WebRTC server implementation
- src/webrtc/signaling.rs - WebSocket signaling session handler
- src/api/webrtc.rs - REST API endpoints for WebRTC
- src/webrtc/mod.rs - Module exports
- src/api/mod.rs - Added WebRTC server to AppState

Features Implemented:
✓ WebRTC signaling server with WebSocket support
✓ SDP offer/answer generation and handling
✓ ICE candidate exchange and negotiation
✓ STUN/TURN server configuration
✓ Peer connection lifecycle management
✓ Stream selection per peer
✓ Connection and ICE gathering state monitoring
✓ REST API for WebRTC status and configuration
✓ Test coverage for core functionality

Dependencies Added:
- actix (for actor model)
- actix-web-actors (for WebSocket actors)
- uuid (for peer ID generation)

Current Limitations (for future PRPs):
- Using test video source instead of actual stream integration
- Basic SDP handling without advanced codec negotiation
- No simulcast/SVC support yet
- No DataChannel implementation

Tests Status:
- Unit tests created for WebRTC server creation
- ICE configuration tests implemented
- Peer connection management tests added
- Signaling session tests included

The WebRTC server is now ready for browser-based streaming connections.
