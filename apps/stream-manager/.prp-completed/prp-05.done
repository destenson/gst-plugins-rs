PRP-05: Stream Source Management
Completed: 2025-09-08

Implementation Summary:
- Created comprehensive StreamSource abstraction with fallbacksrc integration
- Implemented automatic source type detection (RTSP, HTTP, FILE, Unknown)
- Added decodebin3 for robust format handling and dynamic pad management
- Built statistics monitoring system with health status reporting
- Created timeout handling and reconnection logic
- Implemented message bus handling with async communication
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all source functionality

Key Features Implemented:
✓ fallbacksrc element integration with configurable timeouts
✓ Source type detection based on URI schemes
✓ Health monitoring with configurable thresholds
✓ Statistics collection (retry counts, buffering, frame timestamps)
✓ Dynamic pad handling with ghost pad creation
✓ Async message passing for pipeline integration
✓ Thread-safe source management in StreamManager
✓ Proper resource cleanup and error handling

Validation Results:
✓ All 19 unit tests pass
✓ Stream source tests (6 tests) all pass
✓ Build check passes with no errors
✓ fallbacksrc configuration working correctly
✓ Statistics collection functional
✓ Health status accurately reflects source state
✓ Pad connections handled dynamically

Files Created/Modified:
- src/stream/source.rs (new comprehensive source module)
- src/stream/mod.rs (enhanced with source management)
- src/lib.rs (updated error types)
- Cargo.toml (added futures dependency)

Architecture:
- StreamSource struct with Clone derive for pipeline integration
- SourceType enum for automatic URI-based detection
- SourceHealth enum with Unknown, Healthy, Degraded, Unhealthy states
- SourceStatistics struct tracking all relevant metrics
- HealthThresholds for configurable monitoring parameters
- Async message handling with mpsc channels
- Integration with existing pipeline abstraction layer

The implementation successfully provides robust stream source management using fallbacksrc, meeting all PRP-05 requirements and providing a solid foundation for stream branching and recording functionality.
