# rtspsrc2

Rust rewrite of rtspsrc, with the purpose of fixing the fundamentally broken
architecture of rtspsrc. There are some major problems with rtspsrc:

1. Element states are linked to RTSP states, which causes unfixable glitching
   and issues, especially in shared RTSP media
2. The command loop is fundamentally broken and buggy, which can cause RTSP
   commands such as `SET_PARAMETER` and `GET_PARAMETER` to be lost
3. The combination of the above two causes unfixable deadlocks when doing state
   changes due to external factors such as server state, or when seeking
4. Parsing of untrusted RTSP messages from the network was done in C with the
   `GstRTSPMessage` API.
5. Parsing of untrusted SDP from the network was done in C with the
   `GstSDPMessage` API

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Unit tests have been added for the RTSP plugin. Run them with:

```bash
cargo test -p gst-plugin-rtsp rtspsrc
```

The test suite includes:
* Element registration and creation tests
* Property getter/setter validation  
* State transition testing
* Protocol parsing tests
* Signal connection tests

### Mock RTSP Server

A mock RTSP server has been implemented for testing RTSP protocol interactions:

```bash
cargo test -p gst-plugin-rtsp mock_server
```

The mock server provides:
* Basic RTSP command support (OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, SETUP, PLAY, TEARDOWN)
* Configurable SDP responses
* Session management
* TCP listener on configurable port

Note: Integration tests with the actual rtspsrc2 element are still in development

### Connection Retry Configuration

The rtspsrc2 element supports robust connection retry logic with various backoff strategies:

#### Properties

* `retry-strategy` (string): Connection retry strategy
  - `auto` (default): Automatic strategy selection based on connection conditions
  - `adaptive`: Learning-based optimization (placeholder for future enhancement)
  - `none`: No retry, fail immediately
  - `immediate`: Retry immediately without delay
  - `linear`: Fixed increment delays
  - `exponential`: Power of 2 backoff
  - `exponential-jitter`: Exponential with Â±25% random jitter

* `max-reconnection-attempts` (int): Maximum retry attempts (-1 for infinite, 0 for no retry, default: 5)
* `reconnection-timeout` (nanoseconds): Maximum backoff delay (default: 30 seconds)
* `initial-retry-delay` (nanoseconds): Initial retry delay (default: 1 second)
* `linear-retry-step` (nanoseconds): Step increment for linear strategy (default: 2 seconds)

#### Example Usage

```bash
# Exponential backoff with 10 retry attempts
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc2 location=rtsp://camera.local/stream \
  retry-strategy=exponential \
  max-reconnection-attempts=10 \
  initial-retry-delay=500000000 ! \
  decodebin ! autovideosink

# No retry for testing
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc2 location=rtsp://camera.local/stream \
  retry-strategy=none ! \
  fakesink

# HTTP tunneling (automatic detection)
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc2 location=rtsp://camera.local/stream \
  protocols=tcp,http \
  http-tunnel-mode=auto ! \
  decodebin ! autovideosink

# Force HTTP tunneling on custom port
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc2 location=rtsp://camera.local/stream \
  http-tunnel-mode=always \
  tunnel-port=8080 ! \
  decodebin ! autovideosink
```

### HTTP Tunneling Configuration

The rtspsrc2 element supports HTTP tunneling for RTSP to bypass restrictive firewalls:

#### Properties

* `http-tunnel-mode` (string): HTTP tunneling mode
  - `auto` (default): Automatically detect need for tunneling
  - `never`: Never use HTTP tunneling
  - `always`: Always use HTTP tunneling

* `tunnel-port` (uint): Port to use for HTTP tunneling (default: 80)

* `protocols` (string): Include "http" to enable HTTP as a transport option

### ONVIF Backchannel Support (Preparation)

The rtspsrc2 element has initial support for detecting ONVIF backchannel streams:

* Parses SDP attributes for stream direction (sendonly/recvonly/sendrecv)
* Detects ONVIF backchannel streams in SDP
* Provides sink pad template for future audio return channel
* Emits `backchannel-detected` signal when backchannel stream is found

Note: Full backchannel data flow implementation is pending

## Camera Compatibility Testing
